In some cases, there are technical meanings; for example, a python package is usually made up of one or more modules. But the basic idea for all of these terms (package, module, or library) is that these are extensions to the core language that give you more tools.\n",

The packages also have a large userbase and developer base, and you can find a lot of documentation and help for using these pacakges. You should know about the websites, in case you need to find help or read the manuals:\n",
